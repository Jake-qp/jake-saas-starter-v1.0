## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Waitlist / Pre-Launch Mode (F001-015): Feature-flag gated pre-launch waitlist at `/waitlist`. `WaitlistGate` component redirects unauthenticated visitors to waitlist page when `waitlist_mode` PostHog flag is enabled (no redirect when disabled or unconfigured). Public email collection form with duplicate detection ("already on waitlist" message). `waitlistEntries` Convex table with email (unique), status (pending/approved/rejected), and status index. Admin waitlist management at `/admin/waitlist` with DataTable, search, approve/reject actions. Approved users receive invitation email via Resend (`/api/waitlist/send-invite` API route with graceful degradation when RESEND_API_KEY not configured). Admin sidebar updated with Waitlist nav item. 22 new tests.
- Super Admin Panel (F001-010): Admin dashboard at `/admin` with real-time user, team, and platform metrics. User management at `/admin/users` with DataTable, search, and "View as User" impersonation (read-only, 30-minute auto-expiry, confirmation dialog). Team management at `/admin/teams` with plan tier, subscription status, owner, and member count. Audit log at `/admin/audit` with filterable action history. Analytics page at `/admin/analytics` linking to PostHog dashboard (graceful degradation when unconfigured). `ImpersonationBanner` component with fixed warning bar and exit button. `auditLog` Convex table with actorId, action, timestamp indexes. Impersonation fields (`impersonatingUserId`, `impersonationExpiresAt`) on users table. `adminQuery`/`adminMutation` wrappers enforce `isSuperAdmin` on all admin endpoints. Super admin sidebar layout with 6 nav items. 23 new tests.
- Blog & Changelog (F001-013): MDX blog at `/blog` with listing + individual post pages using `next-mdx-remote` and `@tailwindcss/typography` prose styling. Changelog at `/changelog` with reverse-chronological entries and email subscription form. `changelogSubscribers` Convex table with subscribe/unsubscribe mutations and unique email enforcement. RSS 2.0 feed at `/blog/feed.xml`. `<WhatsNewBadge>` in app header with dot indicator comparing user's `lastSeenChangelogDate` to latest changelog entry. Unsubscribe page at `/changelog/unsubscribe?token=xxx`. `gray-matter` for MDX frontmatter parsing with build-time validation (title, date, description required). Blog/changelog links in marketing nav + footer. 21 new tests.
- Example App — Notes CRUD (F001-011): Full CRUD for team notes at `/t/[teamSlug]/notes` with real-time updates via Convex. Permission-gated: "Contribute" to create, "Manage Content" to edit/delete others' notes. Full-text search via Convex search indexes across titles and content. Entitlement gating (Free: 50 notes, Pro/Enterprise: unlimited). File attachment support via `attachmentStorageIds`. Global command palette (`Cmd+K`) with `<CommandPalette>` component searching notes and members, recent items, and navigation shortcuts. Soft deletion. 17 new tests.
- Feature Flags (F001-008): PostHog feature flag management with `useFeatureFlag(key)` returning boolean (defaults to `false` when PostHog unconfigured), `useFeatureFlagWithPayload(key)` for JSON payloads, admin flag management UI at `/admin/flags` (list, create, toggle, delete) proxying PostHog REST API via Next.js API routes, `isSuperAdmin` field on users table, `adminQuery`/`adminMutation` wrappers enforcing super admin access, `POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY` server-only (never exposed to client)
- Onboarding System (F001-007): Multi-step onboarding wizard for new users at `/t/[teamSlug]/onboarding`. 3-step wizard (Profile, Team, Get Started) using existing `StepWizard` component. Progress tracked in database (`onboardingStatus` + `onboardingStep` on users table) — persists across sessions. Skip button on every step. Dashboard auto-redirects new users to onboarding; completed/skipped users go straight to dashboard. `lib/onboardingConfig.ts` for step definitions and status helpers. Team rename mutation (`teams.update`) added for workspace naming step.
- Notification System (F001-006): In-app notification bell with unread count badge, real-time notification list with mark-as-read, notification preferences page with per-type email/in-app toggles, `createNotification` internal mutation with preference-aware dispatch, 8 React Email templates (welcome, invite-sent, invite-accepted, subscription-changed, payment-failed, payment-received, approaching-limit, member-removed) with shared `EmailLayout` (brand header + footer), email preview dev route (`/dev/emails`), `buildNotificationMessage()` type-safe message builder, `lib/notificationTypes.ts` notification type registry with defaults.

Full mutation pattern: authenticate → authorize ("Use AI" permission) → entitle (aiCredits) → rate limit (20/min) → execute. Credit tracking via `decrementCredits()` with calendar-month periods. `lib/aiModels.ts` shared model configuration.

Convex file storage backend (`convex/storage.ts`) with signed URL upload flow, avatar management (save/remove for users and teams), file deletion with storage cleanup, and team file listing. Shared validation config (`lib/fileConfig.ts`) as single source of truth for allowed types, size limits, and avatar constraints. `useFileUpload` hook for 3-step Convex upload flow with progress tracking. Storage quota enforcement via `checkEntitlement(ctx, teamId, "storageQuotaMB")` with per-tier limits (Free: 100MB, Pro: 1GB, Enterprise: unlimited). `files` table with team edge, purpose indexing, and uploader tracking.
