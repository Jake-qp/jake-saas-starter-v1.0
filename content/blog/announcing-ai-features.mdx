# Announcing AI-Powered Features

We're excited to introduce built-in AI capabilities powered by the Vercel AI SDK.

## What's New

### Streaming Chat

Every team gets access to AI chat with real-time streaming responses. Choose between OpenAI and Anthropic models based on your needs.

### Credit-Based Usage

AI usage is tracked per-team with credit-based billing. Each plan tier includes a monthly credit allocation, and usage resets automatically each billing cycle.

### Rate Limiting

Built-in rate limiting prevents abuse while ensuring fair access for all team members.

## Getting Started

Navigate to the AI Chat section in your team dashboard to start using AI features today.
