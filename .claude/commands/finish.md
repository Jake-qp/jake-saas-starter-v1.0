Complete the current work and prepare for handoff:

1. **Update documentation** — Review what changed this session and update all relevant documentation so future agents and humans can continue seamlessly. Consult the project's documentation rules and conventions to determine what needs updating.

2. **Commit and push** — Commit all changes with a descriptive message and push to main.

3. **Generate continuation prompt** — Based on the project's implementation plan and current progress, write a complete prompt that the next agent can use to pick up where you left off. Include relevant context, the next feature to build, and any decisions or considerations discovered during this session.
